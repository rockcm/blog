      <h1>Lessons from Automating Code Metrics at CGI</h1>
      <p class="blog-date">Date: January 2025</p>
      <p>
        Working as a Software Developer Intern at CGI has given me incredible insights into 
        enterprise-level automation and the impact it can have on development workflows. 
        In this post, I'll share the key lessons I learned from migrating our code counting 
        process and achieving a 3000% performance improvement.
      </p>
      
      <h2>The Problem</h2>
      <p>
        Our existing code counting process was running on Windows and was painfully slow. 
        What used to take hours could be reduced to minutes with the right approach. 
        The challenge wasn't just about speed - it was about reliability, maintainability, 
        and integration with our existing CI/CD pipeline.
      </p>
      
      <h2>The Solution</h2>
      <p>
        I migrated the entire process from Windows to Linux and implemented several 
        automation scripts using Python. The key was not just changing the platform, 
        but rethinking the entire workflow:
      </p>
      
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Platform Migration:</strong> Moved from Windows to Linux for better performance</li>
        <li><strong>Python Automation:</strong> Created scripts for encrypted file configuration management</li>
        <li><strong>Jenkins Integration:</strong> Automated execution of code counts and configurations</li>
        <li><strong>Error Handling:</strong> Implemented robust error handling and logging</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Key Technical Insights</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Encrypted File Management:</strong> Working with encrypted files taught me the importance 
        of secure configuration management. Ensuring files are properly encrypted while 
        maintaining automation workflows requires careful planning.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <strong>Performance Optimization:</strong> The 3000% improvement didn't come from 
        one magic solution, but from multiple optimizations working together - better 
        algorithms, more efficient I/O operations, and parallel processing where possible.
      </p>
      
      <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Always measure before and after - metrics matter</li>
        <li>Automation is only as good as its error handling</li>
        <li>Documentation is crucial for team adoption</li>
        <li>Sometimes the biggest wins come from platform changes, not just code optimization</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Impact</h2>
      <p>
        This project not only improved our team's efficiency but also gave me hands-on 
        experience with enterprise automation tools like Jenkins. The performance gains 
        have allowed our team to focus on higher-value work instead of waiting for 
        processes to complete.
