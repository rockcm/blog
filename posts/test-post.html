      <h1>Building My First Full-Stack Application</h1>
      <p class="blog-date">Date: December 2024</p>
    <p>
      In this post, I'll walk you through my journey of building my first full-stack application - 
      a React video recording and uploading app with a Python FastAPI backend. This project 
      was a significant learning experience that taught me about modern web development, 
      API design, and the challenges of handling file uploads and streaming.
    </p>
    
    <h2>The Challenge</h2>
    <p>
      I wanted to create something that would push my boundaries as a developer. Having 
      experience with both React and Python, I decided to combine them into a full-stack 
      application that could handle video recording, uploading, and streaming.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Technical Stack</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Frontend:</strong> React with modern hooks and functional components</li>
      <li><strong>Backend:</strong> Python FastAPI for high-performance API development</li>
      <li><strong>Database:</strong> SQLite for development, with plans to migrate to PostgreSQL</li>
      <li><strong>File Storage:</strong> Local file system with metadata tracking</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Key Features Implemented</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Webcam recording using MediaRecorder API</li>
      <li>Video upload with progress tracking</li>
      <li>Metadata storage and retrieval</li>
      <li>Video streaming and playback</li>
      <li>File management and deletion</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
    <p>
      This project taught me the importance of proper error handling, the complexity of 
      file uploads, and how to design RESTful APIs that are both efficient and 
      user-friendly. The integration between frontend and backend was more challenging 
      than I initially anticipated, but the end result was incredibly rewarding.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Next Steps</h2>
    <p>
      I'm planning to add user authentication, cloud storage integration, and real-time 
      features to make this a more production-ready application. The learning never stops!
