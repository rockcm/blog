      <h2>Welcome</h2>
      <p>
        Hello!! I'm Christian Rock, a passionate software developer currently pursuing my BS in Computing 
        at East Tennessee State University. I'm also working as a Software Developer Intern at CGI, where 
        I've been able to apply my skills in automation and full-stack development.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        I specialize in full-stack development with experience in C#, .NET, Python, React, and database management. 
        My journey in software development has been driven by a love for problem-solving and creating efficient, 
        user-friendly applications.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new technologies, contributing to open-source projects, 
        or sharing my learning experiences through my blog. I'm always eager to take on new challenges and 
        collaborate with fellow developers.
